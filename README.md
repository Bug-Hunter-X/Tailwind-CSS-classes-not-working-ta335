# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied correctly.  The issue typically arises from problems with the build process, configuration errors, or missing plugins.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution.

**Problem:**

The Tailwind CSS classes in `bug.js` are not rendering as expected. This is because the Tailwind build process might not have been run correctly or there is some missing configuration.

**Solution:**

The `bugSolution.js` file contains the corrected code and outlines the steps to resolve the problem.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Ensure your project is properly configured to use Tailwind CSS, including the installation of required packages.
2. Create the code snippet from `bug.js` in your application. 
3.  Observe that the Tailwind classes are not applied.
4. Implement the changes from `bugSolution.js` to correct the issue.
